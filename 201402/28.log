- thought a lot about what we are doing, confusions, hypothesis, experiments
- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FcZyX-MRb2iV5KpsujjP-FoXxcQj7DmO2SjjeJjwH9A/edit
- tried some iperfs + tcpdump + fping but manually very tough

TODO:
- finish script and run it at home multiple runs of 10 sec each
-- need to check if diff between RS for no traffic and traffic conditions based on bottleneck
-- uplink AS traffic should have huge difference in RS/SR
-- downlink SA traffic should have difference is AR/RA
- confirm on server, router, client, that stuff runs together - now that we aren't threading
- create iperf A to S and take tcpdump at A, R, S
- vice versa

Other TODOs:
- email renata+anna and then nick+srikanth with refined version of Q/A doc
- finish appu background and version
- apply stephan's tc script and redo experiment 50 times with 10mbit increases instead of 5
- how does tc work
- Study bufferbloat, network algo for quals
