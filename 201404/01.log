1200 - 1700 cwnd vs mac retrans plots
1800 - 1900 discussion with abhinav and srikanth
            - concentrate on 2 main results and get data from many homes
            1. case for split tcp
            - if e2e < segment bw consistently across many homes
            -- see slight AS < RS reported by iperf, but not by tcptrace
            -- only tested good channel for now, need to test bad channel
            2. study of bufferbloat
            - if bismark ul and my ul show huge latency jumps during traffic
            -- this happens when router generates data not when client
            -- is probably a limitation of the router only

1900 - 2100 iperf and tcptrace boxplots
2200 - 0430 channel retransmissions and bitrates boxplots
            bufferbloat and loss barplots

SUMMARY
=======
DONE - boxplots across multiple experiments to confirm
DONE -- AS < AR and RS
TODO -- SA < RA and SR *needs fix*

DONE - bufferbloat does it happen when I introduce traffic?
TODO -- quantify it from multiple homes
TODO -- study bismark data RS_baseline v/s RS_underload as motivation


FIXES:
* CWND v/s Retrans plot:
    - y axis retrans as a % of total number of packets in that second
    - y axis cwnd in scientific notation

* fix SR measurement using netperf?
* fix iperf at R
* try udp flooding traffic to measure bufferbloat and udp stream to get rtt
