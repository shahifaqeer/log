16: 1420 - 1500
  WTF evaluation method - two parameters
  1. RTT of perf flow: if RTT full_sz avg > 15 ms => wireless is not a bottleneck
    tcptrace -rln tcpdump_R.pcap
    usually tcptrace should be taken on br-lan for this
  2. Coefficient of variability

  CSI: packet delivery - how does it make sense?
  - connect it to throughput somehow

    1630 - 1800: read csi, email about csi

17: try wtf analysis on my collected data
    adapt srikanth's scripts accordingly
18: talk to srikanth regarding wtf
      wtf only works on downlink SA and SR (RA doesn't make sense here)
      rtt - look at the downlink flow from S
    collect wireless good data at home
    TODO
      run wtf on wireless good, wireless bad, and test traces from lab
      fix the parser for rtt avg for the right Sx flow
      see coeff for those flows which actually saturate the uplink (~ 5000 packets)
      collect data at arpit's place
      somehow collect wireless bad data...
19:0 :(
20:0 :(
21:0 :(
22: WTF analysis on wireless good and congested
23: turns out wireless good isn't really "good"
    also need to study wireless tcp - meeting on friday
24: FIGURE OUT RADIOTAP -> TCP HEADER CONVERSION
    analyze wired tcp with 18 +/- 10 ms delay (19)
    analyze wireless_okay and wireless_congested new datasets (20 each)
    analyze arpit's home wireless (30)
    analyze hnl1 wireless good access link varying dataset (20)
    give laptop to yogesh for wireless_good access_link bottleneck case
