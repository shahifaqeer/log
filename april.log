  WTF evaluation method - two parameters
  1. RTT of perf flow: if RTT full_sz avg > 15 ms => wireless is not a bottleneck
    tcptrace -rln tcpdump_R.pcap
    usually tcptrace should be taken on br-lan for this
  2. Coefficient of variability

  CSI: packet delivery - how does it make sense?
  - connect it to throughput somehow

    1630 - 1800: read csi, email about csi
