0030 - 0100 : Meeting with Nick:
            - one shot measurement may not capture anything as the
            channel varies too fast.
            - user performance issue should be indicated from browser
            get indicator; collect passive trace; do active
            measurement while collecting trace.
            * do I need some way to show passive v/s active measurement?
            - use ping time medians for bufferbloat jump
            - mark's experiment + passive trace seems like a good idea
0100 - 0130 : try some wireshark over router capture from controlled exp
            TODO: add radiotap capture to controlled experiments for both
            router and client devices - main.py and utils.py

TODO:
controlled experiment analysis
- iperf, probe
- ping latencies, losses
- tcpdump > tcptrace instant throughput
* radiotap > tshark # retrans and bitrate
- did not take radiotap yet [TODO]
real data analysis
