- Send meeting minutes
- Reading group paper

- Write my research
-- the main idea of this paper is...
-- just show end results not journey to it
-- problems:
  - udp
  - router + tcpdump util limit
  - active measurements limitations impact real data
-- solutions:
  - multi tcp
  - interface counters
  - another wired node
-- what is wireless bw measurement? TCP and UDP
-- variation in measurements - why?

Research:
- TCP test segment wise - 10 threaded
- UDP test e2e ratios at home 2 sec
- WTF confirm
- check ping values baseline and ul
- Try another router with openwrt + SAR output

TODO program:
- SAR values
- tcpdump bandwidth of the particular flow
- proper common graphs for udp, tcp, pro
- iperf recv_bytes fixed and output
- node B instead of router (capacity measurements)
- node C instead of router (wireless)
  > FATHOM_NODES, NON_FATHOM_NODES
- traceroute for udp problems
- reread netalyzr...?
