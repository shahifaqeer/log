TODO:

-- iperf throughput v/s tcpdump throughput (A, R, S) for each segment for traffic -> scatter plot with marker size ~ variance per traffic
-- individual iperf, channel and throughput plots (after migrating ipynb code to a script)
-- segment vs channel for traffic: num_retrans boxplot, total % bitrate for each rate -> AR vs RA channel
-- segment vs tcp quality for traffic: CWND, TDAs -> is there a diff in CWND for AS traffic and AR traffic?
