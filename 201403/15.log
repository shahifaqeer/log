An important question: should I use pings or a small iperf flow to get queueing delays, RTTs etc?



Projects

- Where is the bufferbloat in homenetworks?
    - Wifi buffer ← study wired v/s wifi v/s directly from router
    - Router buffer (shouldn’t happen with BISmark lancre, should happen with quirm/klatch) ← should be able to tell in experimental testbed which has no modem buffer
    - Modem buffer ← how to differentiate this with below? Its a layer 2 device? Can I ping it?
    - Last mile buffer (first hop from modem to ISP) ← should be able to tell with PAM14 method
    - AS (core) ← PAM14 method applied on each hop in traceroute (maybe need an MTR type tool for this?)
    - Destination ← observe upload and download bufferbloat at destination riverside.

- Is performance of TCP split at router better than TCP e2e over wireless?
    - need to study cases where iperf TCP AR, RS > AS and vice versa
