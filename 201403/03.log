1330 - 1415 : rerun client.py script to see where its getting stuck.
            indx keeps getting printed - thats not good.
            script did not get stuck - that's good.
            TODO: analysis of collected data.
            suggestion: put script on lab laptop and open a reverse ssh
            channel through chrontab and give laptop to people.
