1500 - 1630 : check script1500 - check script1500 - check script
2200 - 2300 : fix uploads by creating new user browserlab but this 
            requires sudo sshing once into router and riverside. need
            a better way. fix it using strictkeycheck=no flag with scp.
2330 - 0130 : fix permissions and folders so that all logs get scp to
            home/browserlab/data/<folder> with a 777 permission set.
            also use sudo install -D -t /usr/local/bin/ udpprober to
            install shaperprobe and iperf-reverse on client easily
            checked all processes work fine in right order!
            TODO: might need a way to distinguish the user... maybe
            a folder name using the mac address from ifconfig?
0200 - 0330 : preliminary results of latency under load test done. Just
            one run of tests from my laptop show a 10 ms increase on 
            avg on the avg RTT on RS. These values will not be reliable
            unless we do multiple runs of the tests and take avg.
