1600 - 1700 : stupid schedule argument bug in script. Now running on hnl2
            also missing sshpass
1830 - 1900 : fixed bug to print iwconfig etc regularly at 10 sec interval
2300 - 0000 : read ch1 notes 7260
0030 - 0200 : port script to hnl1 + homenetworklab to analyze tc buffer + iperf + udp
0200 - 0500 : collect test traffic for 0mbps, 1mbps, 6mbps bottlenecks from testbed
            analyze some tcpdumps and radiotap headers
            summary in Notes
0500 - 0530 : updated testlogs to work for both real and testbed
            - need to merge it with master now

TODO:
- use test traces from testbed to see if bufferbloat is happening or not
- learn how to play with radiotap
- learn how to get inst. throughput graphs from tcpdump
- analyze udp channel, tcp channel, ping channel, nothing channel from radiotap
- maybe remove tcpdump before and after stage in favor of a larger tcpdump
