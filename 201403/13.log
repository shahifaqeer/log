forgot to update past few days
9, 10, 11, 12 MARCH - worked  on fixing script collection errors
and getting sanitized measurements

- analyzed home data from hnl2 but there are still some measurements
  missing.
- basically described variance in real probing

- analyzed single run from controlled experiment hnl1
- a view of tcpdump and how sometimes tcpdump doesn't correspond to iperf
  report

advise
    - iperf seems more important than udp
    - iperf polling may not really make sense, but lets plot it anyway

TODO: explore each and every graph collected in detail
TODO: do similar tcpdump analysis for real data (eg. anna, my new set, etc)
TODO: still need to check on bufferbloat in real measurements vs controlled
      - is this due to some weird reason like only last mile or bad buffer
APPROACH: for many runs, just plot iperf final and iper polled values,
        wherever we see weirdness, analyze tcpdump for it
TODO: reply to christian, meeting update on browserlab list, share code
      for analyzing measurements.


TODAY:
1400-0100:  GUI for sazo - finally done though with bugs
0400-0530:  papers - PAM2014 RTT
            - paxon strategy for internet measurments
